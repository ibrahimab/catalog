## Laravel PHP Framework

I made this application to learn more about Laravel. It is a catalog application which display categories and products.

to get started:

1) cp .env.example .env
2) edit your database settings
3) composer install
4) php artisan migrate
5) run database/seeds/categories_seeds.sql and database/seeds/products.sql
6) php artisan serve
7) http://localhost:8000
